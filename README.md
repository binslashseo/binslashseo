# hi, I'm seo!
🔨 i'm a tinkering enjoyer, and i've been messing around with old phones and computers since a very young age

💻 i write things that are either useful or pretty (for me, atleast)
### projects i want to take on:
- a text editor written in c or python
- a floating X11 window manager
- a system info fetching utility

that's about it. peace and have fun ❤️️
